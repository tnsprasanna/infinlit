# infinlit
JAMHacks V Project 2021 - Created user input webpage to supplement "infinlit", a mobile application prototype designed to be a financial planner for university students. The accompanying mobile application's user interface (UI) was designed using Canva and the functionality of the app was prototyped on Marvel.
